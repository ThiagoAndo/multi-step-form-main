## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Java Script

### What I learned

I chose the Multi-step form challenge because it seemed to have a reasonable demand for coding. I love coding!
I built this web page using pure Java script and its features like modules, arrow functions and more. JS is an easy and enjoyable program language to code with. The downside of programming with it is that the commands can get a little verbose. That's why most programmers still use libraries such as JQuery.
By completing this great challenge, I got to learn how to test the functionalities of the web page to prevent bugs and make sure that everything works as it is supposed to. I have decided to change the original workflow to provide the user with a better experience. First of all, Once the user writes their data and presses the Next Step button, the page will not allow going back to the form to prevent user input error. Second of all, I let a plan already chosen as a basic plan (Arcade/mo). Finally, If the user does not choose an Add service, the page will ask them if they are sure of passing this advantage.

### Continued development

It is well known that working with dates and strings is not a simple task. It demands the good expertise of the programmer. It is much simpler to perform form validation using the functionalities of HTML 5 (required). However, programming a form validation using a programming language gives more control over what is required from the user. By having to identify the characters typed by the user, I realize the necessity to increase my knowledge of understading regular expressions better. The next step is to get a better grasp of it.
